SaveIm2DICOM.m converts 3DTRUS export from Eigen Artemis into MR-DICOM format. DicomHeader.dcm must also be downloaded. The only change you should make to the file is changing the paths to your 3DTRUS data and to the DicomHeader file. Changes can be made to the SaveIm2DICOM.m file to make the DICOM header tailored to your needs.
