# GYN-Needle-Tracking-TRUStoMRI
These files are compatible with MatLab (MathWorks, Massachusetts).
SaveIm2DICOM.m converts 3D-TRUS image export from Eigen Artemis into MR-DICOM format. DicomHeader.dcm must also be downloaded. The only change you should make to the file is changing the paths to your 3D-TRUS dataset and DicomHeader file. Changes can be made to the SaveIm2DICOM.m file to make the DICOM header tailored to your needs. 

This file is utilized in Lindsey Bloom, MS '24 masters' thesis from Duke University Medical Physics graduate program. The thesis is titled "Developing Novel Needle-Tracking Techniques for Real-Time Transrectal-Guidance in GYN Hybrid HDR Brachytherapy Treatments".
